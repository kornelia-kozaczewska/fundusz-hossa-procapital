# A Python-based analytical tool for portfolio risk management in the Hossa Procapital student fund

An analytical system for **portfolio risk management**, based on:

* **empirical risk measures (VaR, ES, Max Drawdown)**,
* **the Risk Parity model**,
* **the Black–Litterman (BL) model** with weight constraints.

The project integrates trade and valuation data from Excel, fetches historical prices from Yahoo Finance, computes portfolio risk metrics, and generates a comprehensive Excel report.

## Theory

### Empirical Risk

Risk measures are computed without assuming any specific return distribution:

* **VaR (Value-at-Risk)** – maximum expected loss not exceeded with probability `confidence`.
* **ES (Expected Shortfall)** – average loss in the tail beyond VaR.
* **Max Drawdown** – largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio’s value.

### Risk Parity

The goal is to achieve **equal risk contribution** for each asset in the portfolio:

$$
RC_i = w_i(\Sigma w)_i
$$

$$
RC_i = \frac{1}{n}, \quad i = 1, \dots, n
$$

The solution is obtained using **SLSQP optimization** with weight-sum and bound constraints
$w_{min}, w_{max}$.

### Black–Litterman (BL)

The model combines **equal risk contribution (Risk Parity)** with **subjective analyst views**:

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{BL}}
= \left[(\tau\Sigma)^{-1} + P^\top \Omega^{-1} P\right]^{-1}
\left[(\tau\Sigma)^{-1}\pi + P^\top \Omega^{-1} Q\right]
$$

where:

* $π = δΣw_{PR}$ – equilibrium (prior) returns from the Risk Parity model,
* $P, Q$ – matrix and vector of analyst views (expected “upside”),
* $Ω$ – view error covariance (confidence-weighted),
* $τ$ – uncertainty of prior estimates,
* $δ$ – risk aversion coefficient.

Resulting optimal weights are:

$$
w_{\mathrm{BL}} = \frac{1}{\delta}\Sigma^{-1}\mu_{\mathrm{BL}}
$$

In this project, a **practical constrained version** with bounds `bl_box_lb, bl_box_ub` was implemented,
so that the resulting weights can be directly interpreted as realistic portfolio allocations.
